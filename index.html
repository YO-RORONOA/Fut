                    <p class="control">Control-Possession is a tactical approach where the team focuses on maintaining possession of the ball to dictate the tempo of the game. 
                        The goal is to control the match by dominating the midfield, passing the ball around patiently, 
                        and slowly breaking down the opponent's defense. This style is often used by teams that prefer a more methodical approach,
                        ensuring that the opposition has limited opportunities to attack by keeping the ball for extended periods.</p>

                    <p class="tiki">Tiki-Taka is a style of football that emphasizes short, quick passes and maintaining possession, often with the goal of drawing out the opponent's defense. 
                        It involves intricate passing combinations, fluid movement off the ball, and a high level of technical ability.
                        Tiki-Taka is known for its fast-paced, possession-based play, where the team patiently moves the ball around until they find the right opening to penetrate the oppositionâ€™s defense.</p>
                    
                    <p class="wing">Wing-Play is a tactic where the team utilizes the width of the pitch to stretch the opposition's defense. 
                        Wingers or fullbacks move up the field, often delivering crosses into the box for the central attackers to finish. 
                        This style exploits the flanks, 
                        aiming to create goal-scoring opportunities by isolating defenders in wide areas, 
                        allowing for quick and direct attacking play.</p>
                    
                    <p class="route">Route-One is a direct, fast-paced approach to attacking, where the team focuses on quickly moving the ball from defense to attack, 
                        often through long passes or clearances. This tactic bypasses the midfield and aims to quickly find the forward players or the target striker with long balls, 
                        with minimal build-up play. It is often used by teams looking for quick transitions, 
                        particularly when playing against stronger or more organized opposition.</p>
        
                    <p class="counter">Counter-Attack is a strategy where the team absorbs pressure and defends in numbers, waiting for an opportunity to quickly transition from defense to attack. 
                        As soon as possession is regained, the team looks to exploit the spaces left by the opponent, 
                        usually with fast, direct runs or passes aimed at catching the opposition out of position. 
                        This tactic is highly effective against teams that commit many players forward.</p>

                    <p class="balanced">Balanced is a more pragmatic tactical approach where the team strives to find a middle ground between attacking and defending. It involves not overcommitting to one side of the game, 
                        maintaining solid defensive organization while being capable of attacking when the opportunity arises. 
                        The balance between the two aspects ensures that the team is not left vulnerable at the back while still having attacking options to create chances.</p>
